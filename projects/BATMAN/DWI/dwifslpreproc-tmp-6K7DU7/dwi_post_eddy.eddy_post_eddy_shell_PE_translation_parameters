These between shell PE-translations were calculated using MI between shell means
PE-translations (mm) relative b0-shell from direct registration to mean b0
Shell 1e+03 to b0-shell: PE-translation = 0.0903 mm
Shell 2e+03 to b0-shell: PE-translation = -0.0132 mm
Shell 3e+03 to b0-shell: PE-translation = -0.202 mm

Relative PE-translations (mm) between the shells
Shell 2e+03 to shell 1e+03: PE-translation = -0.029 mm
Shell 3e+03 to shell 1e+03: PE-translation = -0.128 mm

Deduced PE-translations (mm) relative b0-shell
Shell 1e+03 to b0-shell: PE-translation = 0.0903 mm
Shell 2e+03 to b0-shell: PE-translation = -0.0132 mm
Shell 3e+03 to b0-shell: PE-translation = -0.202 mm
